          <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒævəˌskrɪpt/[5]) is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.[6] It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.[7] Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern Web browsers without plug-ins.[6] JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented,[8] imperative, and functional programming styles.[6] It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.[7]</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-md">JS info</a>

          <p>Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[14] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[15] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[16] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,[17][18][19][20] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-md">Java info</a>

          <p>PHP is a server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development but is also used as a general-purpose programming language. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994,[5] the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.[6] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[5] but it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[7]</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-md">PHP info</a>

          <p>Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for display and user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.[3]</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-md">Ruby on Rails info</a>

            Perl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. The languages in this family include Perl 5 and Perl 6.[6]

          Though Perl is not officially an acronym,[7] there are various backronyms in use, the best-known being "Practical Extraction and Reporting Language".[8] Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier.[9] Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Perl 6, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language. Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-md">Perl Info</a>

          <p>C (/ˈsiː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-md">C info</a>

            C++ (pronounced cee plus plus, /ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

          It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[5]

          <p>C#[note 2] (pronounced as see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-md">C# info</a>

          <p>SQL (Listeni/ˈɛs kjuː ˈɛl/,[4] or Listeni/ˈsiːkwəl/;[5] Structured Query Language[6][7][8][9]) is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

          Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of a data definition language, data manipulation language, and Data Control Language. The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is, a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-md">SQL info</a>
